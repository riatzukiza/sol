  "Coverage for the agent-loop realtime streaming wiring.

   Regression guard: a queued run must broadcast assistant token deltas on the
   `tokens` channel and lifecycle events (run_completed/run_failed) on the
   `events` channel, scoped to the run's conversation. A prior implementation
   only appended lifecycle events to the run ledger and dropped token deltas
   entirely, so the board chat never showed a reply."

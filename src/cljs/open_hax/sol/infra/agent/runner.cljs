  "Sol agent runner entrypoint.

   Runs are durable: each direct/chat start records a run in EDN-backed
   run-state, appends a session-level event, and executes the turn in a
   background promise kept in the active-runs registry so Node cannot exit
   until all in-flight turns settle. Errors are recorded on the run and
   logged; they do not kill the process.

   The consumer-facing flow is:
     POST /api/agent/direct       -> 202 + run_id
     WS   /ws/stream?run_id=...   -> live run/token events
     GET  /api/agent/run/:id      -> current run state
     GET  /api/agent/run/:id/events -> ordered run event ledger"
